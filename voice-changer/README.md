This directory contains some voice changer examples. The codes used to generate
the audio are currently "under construction", but can be found in

This demo is about color normalized pitch shifting:
If we use a reqular pitch shifting algorithm, the spectral contents of the
audio move with the pitch multiplier. This makes the shift sound unnatural.
Color neutral pitch shifting can be achieved by using a wavelet splicing
method.
