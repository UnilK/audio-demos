complex projection is a method that can be used to change the audio...
without changing how it sound. Basically, it's a no-op.

Complex projection demonstrates a degree of freedom: the "global phase"
of the audio does not matter.

Complex projection demonstrates what the human ear can and can
not hear.

To compile and run the program, run:

make
./projection
